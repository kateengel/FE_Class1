Be responsive to size of the screen using media queries, grid frameworks, and design patterns.

Media query - adjusts based on size screen.


.box {
	width: 200px;
	height: 200px;
	background: red;
}
@media (max-width: 600px) {
	.box {
   
	background: blue;
}
}

320 - smallest number of pixels (this would be on a mobile device).

Whenever you set something multiple times in css sheet, the style closest to bottom takes precedence.

As you change the size, the layout of the page actually changes. 

Start with the mobile aspect (called mobile first) and work towards a bigger screen.This allows for the most simple design first and then to expand as the screen becomes larger.

How to determine what the breakpoints should be?
- Most frequent resolutions.
- Twitter bootstrap
  - up to 768
 - 768 - 992
 - 992 - 1200
 - 1200 and up

- Project will work on all devices

#block behaves like div
#inline-block behaves like a hybrid
#inline elements cannot have a width and a height

Difference between float and in-line block is that float is pushing out of the flow of the page.
